              <p class=img-caption1>Jane Goodall is a primatologist most known for her long-term study of wild chimpanzees in Tanzania. The Gombe chimp observation, which Jane began in 1960, is the world’s longest running continuous wildlife research project.  Through her Jane Goodall Institute, she has become equally well known as a conservationist and a champion of human rights.</p>

                <p id="img-caption4">"At the Gombe Stream Game Reserve (now a national park) in Tanzania, Goodall transformed the scientific research of animals. Silvey says Goodall “focused on chimpanzees as individuals, with distinct personalities. At the time, the scientific community recorded animals as numbers — she insisted that every individual chimp mattered and every one was unique."</p> </div>

              <p id="img-caption5">"When she discovered that the survival of their species was threatened by habitat destruction and illegal trafficking, she developed a breakthrough approach to species conservation that improves the lives of people, animals and the environment by honoring their connectedness to each other. In 1977, she founded the Jane Goodall Institute to ensure that her vision and life’s work continue to mobilize the collective power of individual action to save the natural world we all share."</p>
